INTRO MANIFESTO FOR YOUR iO FOUNDATION PROJECT
Our mission

We are building an open foundation for indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) development.
Our goal is to make the ability to create sealed, private, and resilient computation available to everyone.
We believe the capacity to render software invisible while preserving functionality will become a fundamental requirement for privacy, agency, and trust in the decades ahead.

Unlike traditional commercial entities, our aim is not to capture value, but to enable a new field.
Our focus is on advancing the practice of iO, creating the tools, standards, and infrastructure that developers will rely on to build private-by-design software systems.
We are not constrained by short-term economic incentives; our objective is to ensure that the emergence of invisible computation benefits the world at large.

We believe the ability to hide logic — not just data — should be broadly and evenly accessible.
Computation has long been observable by default; iO offers a path toward computation that is knowable only in what it produces, never in how it operates.
We see this capability as fundamental to autonomy, security, intellectual freedom, and innovation in a world that is increasingly software-defined.

The outcome is uncertain and the work remains difficult, but the goal is correct.
We hope this clarity of purpose attracts the researchers, engineers, and builders who see long-term impact as the highest objective.

Background

For decades, cryptography evolved by protecting increasingly larger slices of computation.
We learned to encrypt messages, then data at rest, then data during use, then even proofs of correctness.
But the algorithms themselves — the logic, the code, the models — have remained exposed.
Software has had no natural shield.

Researchers have pursued indistinguishability obfuscation for more than a decade, driven by its theoretical power: a primitive that, if realized, could serve as a foundation for nearly all of cryptography.
Yet early constructions were prohibitively complex, unwieldy, and far from practical use.

The past years introduced a shift.
New approaches — including simplified lattice-based constructions such as Diamond iO — have reduced barriers once thought insurmountable.
The landscape is still early, but the path has begun to open.

Just as deep learning transformed artificial intelligence by enabling general-purpose learning systems, iO represents the possibility of general-purpose privacy: the ability to take arbitrary computation and cloak it entirely, without loss of functionality.

We believe this capability will be essential for:

protecting proprietary algorithms

enabling private smart contracts

allowing AI systems to operate without exposing their weights

securing sensitive scientific, financial, and governance logic

empowering individuals to compute without surveillance

and providing new foundations for trust-minimized systems

This is not a small step forward — it is a shift in what computation fundamentally is.

Looking forward

Today’s privacy technologies are powerful but narrow.
Zero-knowledge proofs verify correctness without exposing inputs.
Fully homomorphic encryption computes on encrypted data without decrypting it.

But both leave an open wound: the logic remains transparent.

iO addresses the missing dimension — the privacy of the program itself.
This matters not just for security, but for agency.
In a world where algorithms shape choices, transactions, information, and identities, the ability to control the visibility of those algorithms becomes essential.

It’s impossible to predict the timeline of practical iO, just as it was impossible to forecast the breakthroughs that made deep learning viable.
But once the threshold is crossed, the implications extend across everything software touches.

We believe it is crucial that a neutral, open, mission-aligned institution exists to guide this evolution — one that centers safety, accessibility, and the common benefit over proprietary advantage.

Our approach

We aim to build the ecosystem layer for invisible computation:

An SDK that makes sealed logic accessible to any developer.

An IDE and blueprint environment for constructing iO-enabled applications.

A runtime engine that executes obfuscated logic safely and consistently.

A deployment infrastructure for sealed modules across cloud, edge, and on-chain environments.

A research interface enabling the community to experiment with new constructions.

And a commitment to openness: tools, specifications, and standards shared freely.

Just as early compilers, neural networks, and smart contract platforms transformed their fields by making once-esoteric capabilities broadly usable, we intend to do the same for iO.

Our goal is not to own the applications built with iO,
but to enable everyone to build them.

The Foundation

Because of iO’s transformative potential, it is essential that its development be guided by an institution committed to benefit over ownership.
Our work will be open where possible, collaborative by default, and constructed to support the entire ecosystem.

We hope to foster a community of researchers, designers, developers, and cryptographers who believe that invisible computation can become a universal good — and who want to help define the standards, practices, and tools that make it real.

The path ahead is challenging.
The underlying mathematics, engineering, and infrastructure require breakthroughs.
But we believe deeply that the outcome is worth the effort, and that the structure and mission are aligned with what matters most.

If this resonates with you, we invite you to help shape the future of computation.
The era of sealed logic is just beginning.
