# The Privacy Compute Hub

## One Platform. All Privacy Models. Buildable. Deployable. Composable.

We're building the first platform that brings together **ZK circuits, FHE models, and iO-sealed logic** into a single ecosystem — a kind of **Hugging Face for privacy technologies**, with the creation tools of Remix and the visual composition power of n8n.

Where today's privacy tools are fragmented, specialized, and cryptographically intimidating, our platform abstracts everything into one coherent experience:

### **Discover. Build. Connect. Deploy. Run.**

The future of privacy isn't a single primitive —

it's the unification of **ZK**, **FHE**, and **iO** into a single developer experience.

Our platform is that unification.

---

## Our Mission

To make cryptographic privacy — ZK, FHE, and iO —

as accessible and composable as modern AI tooling.

To create the global platform where:

* privacy models live
* sealed logic flows
* cryptographic functions can be discovered, forked, composed
* and full applications can be built and deployed

  **without touching math or cryptography**

We want to be the **standard library of private computation**

and the **default place developers go** when building privacy-first software.

## The Platform in 3 Layers

### 1. The Privacy Model Hub (Hugging Face for ZK / FHE / iO)

A public registry where developers can:

* browse ZK circuits
* browse FHE-enabled models
* browse iO-sealed logic modules
* publish their own privacy components
* fork, remix, extend
* deploy and compose instantly
* share benchmarks, docs, and examples

Think Hugging Face — but instead of LLMs and CV models,

this is:

* ZK snarks/starks
* FHE functions
* iO-sealed computation modules
* hybrid privacy assets
* "private operators" (drop-in logic units)

This becomes the **global library** of privacy computation.

---

### 2. The Builder Layer (Remix + n8n for Privacy)

A full-stack builder that lets developers:

* write code normally (JS/TS/Rust/Python)
* plug in privacy modules
* visually construct workflows (n8n-style graph editor)
* preview how data flows
* choose which steps use ZK, FHE, iO
* auto-compile into sealed or encrypted logic
* deploy with a click

#### Analogy:

* Remix gives you the ergonomics
* n8n gives you the visual workflow
* Our engine gives you the cryptographic transformation layer

Developers don't learn cryptography.

They **compose privacy**.

---

### 3. The Runtime + Deployment Layer ('Vercel for Private Compute')

Once built, apps can deploy to:

* edge runtime
* cloud sealed logic instances
* encrypted FHE compute nodes
* on-chain ZK / iO execution environments
* local secure enclaves

Projects get:

* APIs
* sandboxes
* encrypted pipelines
* sealed logic execution
* usage telemetry without logic leakage
* versioning + rollback + reproducibility

The runtime handles:

* circuit proving
* encrypted evaluation
* iO-sealed artifact execution
* hybrid chaining (ZK → FHE → iO → ZK, etc)

Developers ship **private apps** like they ship normal apps.

---

## Why This Matters

Today:

* ZK is powerful but specialized
* FHE is promising but impractical alone
* iO is the next frontier but inaccessible
* developers must assemble everything manually
* cryptography is siloed, fragmented, hard

Tomorrow:

With our platform:

* privacy becomes modular
* computation becomes unobservable
* developers deploy sealed or encrypted apps
* privacy primitives combine smoothly
* AI and logic become shareable without exposure
* organizations protect algorithms, not just data

We provide **the bridge between the research frontier and builders.**

## The Category We Define

### **"The Privacy Compute Hub"**

or

### **"The Privacy Model Platform"**

or

### **"The Hugging Face of Encrypted & Obfuscated Compute."**

More punchy:

### **"The platform where computation becomes private by default."**

---

## Key Features

### 1. Privacy Model Hub

A global registry of reusable privacy components:

* ZK circuits
* FHE models
* iO modules
* hybrid operators
* blueprints and workflows
* public + private repositories

Each item is versioned, documented, and instantly installable.

---

### 2. Full-Stack Builder

A dual-mode development environment:

#### Code Mode

Use familiar languages (JS/TS/Rust/Python).

Import privacy modules as simple functions.

Compile into encrypted or obfuscated logic.

#### Flow Mode

A visual graph editor:

* chain ZK → FHE → iO steps
* weave data and logic
* define execution rules
* build entire apps without writing crypto

---

### 3. Privacy Runtime Engine

A secure execution layer managing:

* sealed-logic evaluation
* encrypted computation
* ZK validation
* hybrid pipeline orchestration
* deterministic output guarantees

Your logic never reveals itself.

Your data never decrypts.

---

### 4. Instant Deployment

Deploy workflows to:

* cloud
* edge
* local
* enclave
* chain environments

The runtime enforces privacy across all surfaces.

---

## Our Vision

A world where:

* developers build with privacy like they build with functions
* cryptography becomes invisible
* sensitive logic can execute safely anywhere
* models, circuits, and sealed programs are as accessible as ML models today
* every application can be private by default

**We believe privacy is becoming the new standard for computation.**

We're building the platform that makes that standard possible.

---

## Short Intro Version (for website header)

**We're building the Hub for Private Compute —

a platform where developers can discover, build, and deploy privacy models using ZK, FHE, and iO.

A Hugging Face for private computation, with the developer experience of Remix and the workflow composition of n8n.**
